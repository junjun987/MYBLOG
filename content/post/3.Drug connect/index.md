title: Development of a Methodology for Measuring Similarity for Hypertension Drugs Across Different Healthcare Institutions
---

# **Project Description**

From March to September 2023, I participated in a project focused on the methodology of drug evaluation. The main objective was to explore and establish a method for measuring the level of integration of current hypertension drugs across various hierarchical levels of medical institutions in China. Essentially, within this project, we aimed to observe the effectiveness of the implementation of China's hierarchical medical system.

# **What I did**

-   Analyzed the current situation of hypertension medication in Shanghai

-   Explored methodologies, primarily focusing on **distance algorithms** and **Coupling Coordination Degree** from physics, to develop an algorithm for measuring similarity

-    Delivered oral presentations

-   Wrote a report
