# **Project Description**

From June to September 2023, I participated in the second project of
adjusting China's threshold using discrete choice experiments:
**"Equity-based weighting for public insurance reimbursement threshold
adjustment among general public"**. In this project, we primarily aim to
understand the willingness to pay of the general population in China,
their aversion to inequality and risk. (The project is currently
ongoing.)

# **What I did**

## 1.Designed the Discrete Choice Experiment

-   Conducted a literature review (found the key factors for experiment)

-   Designed the model and checked constraints

-   Designed questions using Ngene

-   Conducted a simulation to check the validity of the model

## 2.Participated in the design of questionnaires on inequality aversion and risk aversion

-   literature review : integrated measures of inequality aversion and
    risk aversion

-   Designed a questionnaire on "inequality aversion"

# **Some of my thoughts**

## About inequality aversion

While extensively reading articles on inequality aversion, I've noticed
that **most current measures of inequality aversion are based on
parameters derived from income and health**. If people's aversion to
income inequality is greater than their aversion to health inequality,
**can these parameters truly reflect people's aversion to health
inequality?** Additionally, do different diseases and population
characteristics lead to different levels of aversion to health
inequality? **Does this parameter, which combines income and health,
have universality?**

## About adjusting threshold

**While adjusting thresholds based on equity factors, inequality
aversion should also be considered.** It would be unreasonable to expand
inequality by adjusting thresholds solely based on equity.
