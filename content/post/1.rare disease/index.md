title: Publicly funded insurance reimbursement threshold adjustment for rare diseases---an equity-based approach among decision-makers
---

# **Project Description**

From March to June 2023, I participated in a research project **investigating Chinese decision-makers' preferences on adjusting the threshold for rare diseases using a discrete choice experiment methodology**. In this project, we conducted one-on-one interviews with decision-makers to understand their thoughts and preferences on adjusting the threshold for rare diseases. This study provides a scientific basis for establishing a rational, scientific, and dynamic basis for adjusting the threshold for rare diseases in China.

# **What I did**

- Supported work for DCE questionnaire design, such as finding some literature to support the study, calculating some key numbers used in the questionnaire, and checking the validity

- Conducted the pilot study, revised the questionnaire, and made the final version of the questionnaire

- Conducted some one-on-one interviews with decision-makers regarding their willingness to pay for a QALY for rare diseases

- Supported data analysis work, such as data cleaning

- Compiled and composed the detailed report

# **Some of my thoughts**

What should be the criteria for setting a threshold? Is it fair to establish a specific threshold for rare diseases? If a threshold is set for rare diseases, should different standards be set for different rare diseases?

Shouldn't the criteria for setting thresholds be based more on the social disease characteristics of the patient population, rather than the single disease characteristics?
