title: Publicly funded insurance reimbursement threshold adjustment for rare diseases---an equity-based approach among decision-makers
---

# **Project Description**

From March 2023 to June 2023, I participated in a research project **investigating Chinese experts' preferences on adjusting the threshold for rare diseases using a discrete choice experiment methodology**. In this project, we conducted one-on-one interviews with experts to understand their thoughts and preferences on adjusting the threshold for rare diseases. This study provides a scientific basis for establishing a rational, scientific, and dynamic basis for adjusting the threshold for rare diseases in China.

# **Some of my thoughts**
What should be the criteria for setting a threshold? Is it fair to establish a specific threshold for rare diseases? If a threshold is set for rare diseases, should different standards be set for different rare diseases? 

Shouldn't the criteria for setting thresholds be based more on the social disease characteristics of the patient population, rather than the single disease characteristics?
