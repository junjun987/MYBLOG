abstract: Objective:To understand the difference of reproductive intention and its influencing factors between migrant women and resident women, so as to provide references for improving supporting measures under the three-child policy. Methods:Based on the China Migrants Dynamic Survey(volumes C and D) in 2017 and China City Statistical Yearbook 2018, Chi-square tests and unordered multi-nominal logistic models with stepwise regression were employed to compare reproductive intention to have a second child between migrant women and resident women, and analyze their influencing factors. Results:Among 4064 resident women and 4191 migrant women included in the analysis, 13.4% and 11.1% respectively intended to have a second child in recent two years, which was significantly different(P<0.01). The reproductive intention for two groups of women was both influenced by age, marital status, number of children, and gender structure of children. Resident women's reproductive intention was additionally influenced by ethnicity, type of housing, self-rated health, and GDP per capita of the city, while distinctive factors of migrant women's reproductive intention were mainly education level, average monthly household income, number of cities they had migrated, plan to stay, difference of beds per 10000 population between the two cities. Conclusion:Compared with resident women, the intention of migrant women who intended to have a second child is statistically lower. It's suggested to take measures considering commonality and individuality of influencing factors for both groups of women to increase their reproductive intention.
