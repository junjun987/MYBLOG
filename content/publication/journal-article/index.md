abstract: Objectives:This study examined the associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and diabetes within a social-ecological framework, incorporating personal and environmental unfavorable conditions during childhood from family, school, and community contexts.Methods:Data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2014 life history survey and 2015 survey), including 9179 participants aged ≥45 years. ACEs were collected through self-report questionnaires, and participants were categorized based on the number of distinct ACEs experienced (0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 ACEs). Diabetes was defined by biomarkers, self-reported diagnosis, and treatment status. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the associations between ACEs and diabetes. Subgroup analyses were conducted by gender, age, and obesity status.Results:Compared with participants without ACEs, those exposed to any ACE (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.40), 3 ACEs (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.62) and ≥4 ACEs (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07-1.56) had an increased risk of diabetes. For each additional ACE, the risk of diabetes increased by about 5%. Regarding the source of ACEs, those originating from the family (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08-1.41) were associated with diabetes. In terms of specific ACE types, family members with substance abuse (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.52), emotional abuse (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12-1.46), and poor parental relationship (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09-1.43) were associated with diabetes.Conclusion:ACEs, particularly those originating from the family, were associated with diabetes. Interventions aimed at preventing and mitigating ACEs are essential for the early prevention of diabetes.
