I'm currently a public health graduate student at Zhejiang University, with an expected graduation date in the summer of 2024. At the university's Global Health Research Center, I'm supervised by [Prof.Therese Hesketh](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/4712-therese-hesketh) and [Prof.Peige Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=XmXf-W8AAAAJ). 

My past research has primarily focused on three areas: Global Health, Health Technology Assessment (HTA), and the issues of health equity and inequality. At present, I'm immersing myself in the study of health economics modeling. I've previously served as a Research Associate at the [Shanghai Health Technology Assessment Research Department](https://kygl.shdrc.org/), where I was supervised by [Dr. Haiyin Wang](https://www.sciconf.cn/cn/person-detail/449?user_id=KzMAIk_jic_xx7Boyic5xkVg_d_d) and [Dr. Shan Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=TeSuUycAAAAJ). My primary focus during this internship was a project dedicated to adjusting thresholds within China, utilizing the Discrete Choice Experiment.

**My ambition is to become a health economist, with the intention of using the tools and methodologies of health economics to address and hopefully reduce health inequalities within society.**
